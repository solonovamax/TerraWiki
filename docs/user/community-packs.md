## Partial Packs

The following packs are intended to provide a small handful of content such as a few biomes, collections of structures,
and or other miscellaneous configs.

Potential applications of partial packs may include:
* Merging content such as biomes and structures into other packs.
* Using the pack generation as a canvas for building.
* Generating themed event worlds.

These packs may not contain enough content to warrant standalone use, and may require some knowledge of Terra
configurations for applications like merging into other packs.
